        contents:
        'HTML, which stands for "Hypertext Markup Language," is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It forms the foundation of every webpage you encounter while browsing the internet. HTML uses a system of tags and elements to define the structure of a webpage, indicating how the content should be displayed in a web browser. HTML is just one of the building blocks of web development. To create visually appealing and interactive websites, developers often use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic behavior. Together, these technologies form the core of front-end web development, allowing developers to craft captivating user experiences on the internet.'
